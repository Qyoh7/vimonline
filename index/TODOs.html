<h2>Vim Editor Online TODO</h2>

<p>
"github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm" is a great starting point. However we plan on adding
a lot more features to make this as good as the vim you're used to. This is our TODO list.
</p>

<ul>
  <!-- <li></li> -->
  <li>TODO: "Upload file" button</li>
  <li>TODO: Able to directly edit the filesystem.</li>
  <li>TODO: Implement loading of vim sessions from a persistent file.</li>
  <li>TODO: Implement support for a plugin such as Vundle.</li>
  <li>TODO: mouse support</li>
  <li>TODO: vim command history (`:e ~/.vim` and uparrow should go up history)</li>
  <li>TODO: vim account management. Be able to open source code from anywhere in the world. Use vimrc across machines/browsers</li>
  <li>TODO: allow creation of new directories.</li>
  <li>TODO: When user loads a file not in filesystem, then load NEW files from IndexedDB. This is VERY technically challenging. Requires a sleep in the Web Worker to make IndexedDB call look synchronous.</li>
  <li>TODO: Make paste work in Vim's command line mode `:`</li>
  <li>TODO: check what is the string limit on Web Worker name, which impacts how large the filesytem can be.</li>
</ul>
